def get_spikes_with_history(neural_data,bins_before,bins_after,bins_current=1):
    """
    Function that creates the covariate matrix of neural activity
    Parameters
    ----------
    neural_data: a matrix of size "number of time bins" x "number of neurons"
        the number of spikes in each time bin for each neuron
    bins_before: integer
        How many bins of neural data prior to the output are used for decoding
    bins_after: integer
        How many bins of neural data after the output are used for decoding
    bins_current: 0 or 1, optional, default=1
        Whether to use the concurrent time bin of neural data for decoding
    Returns
    -------
    X: a matrix of size "number of total time bins" x "number of surrounding time bins used for prediction" x "number of neurons"
        For every time bin, there are the firing rates of all neurons from the specified number of time bins before (and after)
