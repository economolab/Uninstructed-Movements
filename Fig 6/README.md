# uninstructedMovements_v2

## TODO
- new code for kinematics
- new code for kaufman
- new code for pca
- new code for ta-elsayed
- new code for st-elsayed
- need JEB14 Motion Energy
- calc move and non-move time points as in. 
    -- How they automated finding 'quiet' trials in Zencai's paper:
"Trials with mean motion energy during the delay epoch lower than a threshold were defined as quiet trials. 
The threshold was calculated as the pre-sample (1s) mean motion energy minus 0.8 times standard deviation. 
These quiet trials with little movement in jaw, whisker pad and nose accounted for 
3.9%, 9.7% and 1.4% of all trials, respectively."
    -- could be good but assumes little motion in presample period
