% Function for assigning trials a group number based on their delay length
% INPUTS: 
% met = current meta file
% conditions = cell array of the conditions that you want to look at
% delaylen = (nTrials x 1) array where each entry is the delay length for
% that trial

% OUTPUTS:
% Adds a field 'del_trialid' to met (1 x numConditions) cell array.  Each
% entry is a (nTrials x 1) array that lists the delay length group that the
% trial belongs to
