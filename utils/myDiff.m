% calculate numerical gradient of a vector. Uses 2nd order centered
% difference for main part of vector, and first order forward/backward
% difference for boundaries

% turns out this is just the same as the gradient function in matlab
function d = myDiff(x,dt)

% boundaries
d(1) = (x(2) - x(1)) / dt;
d(length(x)) = ( x(end) - x(end-1) ) / dt;

% main part
idx = 2:(length(x)-1);
d(idx) = (x(idx+1) - x(idx-1)) / (2 * dt);

end
