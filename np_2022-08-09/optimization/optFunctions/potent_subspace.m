function [Q, Qcost, info, options] = potent_subspace(Q_null,C1, d1, C2, d2, options)
%manifold optimization to two orthogonal subspaces that maximize the sum of variance captured.
%This file is called by other files.
%C1 = covariance matrix 1
%d1 = number of dimensions of C1 to sum in trace.
%C2 = covariance matrix 2
%d2 = number of dimensions of C2 to sum in trace.
